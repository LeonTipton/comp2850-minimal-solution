P2_notes: (06/12/2025)
Popup does appears on submission of a task - would be slighlty difficult to read without SR voice
No obvious method for changing theme - did not know how to change theme of browser
Easy to navigate with a keyboard - requires lots of tabbing to add multiple tasks consecutively
No change to any component except for the highlighted box around them until clicked
Manual change of browser setings took a long time, but once figured out the dark theme works well
No subtitles of any form

Disliked the contrast in light mode
Found the page accessible but not easy to use
