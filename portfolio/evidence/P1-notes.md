Popup clearly visible
No way of changing theme in the webpage
Easy to navigate with keyboard - easy to add multiple tasks without constant redirection to correct box
No changes to any component when hovering over elements
After manually changing browser theme, there were no issues with readability in dark mode - preferred
No subtitles when SR speaks

Would like to be able to add more detail to each task
No issues with functionality
